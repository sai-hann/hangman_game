# Hangman Game

Word Guessing Game written with **Java**, UI for **Java Swing**.  
It is for NCC Level 4 Java Project assignment from KBTC-School of IT College.  
It has a jar file as far as I test it, it can run also on windows and linux.

## What do you need to run it?

- java JRE (I use jre21)
- mysql server
- hangman_db.sql file for recording users and words.

## For Mysql Connection

1. Create user with username **"hangman"**
1. Use password **"Hangman3142"** for that user.
1. create and restore **"hangman_db"** with that given hangman_db.sql
1. You can run from src folder or just run the jar file.
