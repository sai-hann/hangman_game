# Hangman Game

Word Guessing Game written with **Java**, UI for **Java Swing**.  
It is for NCC Level 4 Java Project assignment from KBTC-School of IT College.  
It has a jar file as far as I test it, it can run also on windows and linux.

## What do you need to run it?
- java JRE
- mysql server
- hangman_db.sql file for recording users and words.
